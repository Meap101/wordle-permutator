# wordlepermutator
Permutes simulated games of Wordle for every 5 letter word based off of a given starter

ever had a gnarly argument with your friends over which wordle starter reigns supreme? now you can casework all your problems away with a script that will permute every test case for you (keep in mind there is a little bit of RNG involved as I've yet to develop a heuristic algorithm between choosing possible next guesses, so expect a small margin of error)

i would've made this in python but my python proficiency ðŸ“‰
