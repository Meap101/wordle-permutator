# wordlepermutator
Permutes simulated games of Wordle for every 5 letter word based off of a given starter
Ever had a gnarly argument with your friends over which wordle starter reigns supreme? Now you can casework all your problems away with a script that will permute every test case for you (keep in mind there is a little bit of RNG involved, as is to be expected). Next guesses based on the amount of permutations they eliminate (assuming all new information will be in the form of gray letters).

And if, for whatever reason, you care THAT much, there is a `results` list object which results for every possible word the simulation ran tests on.

i am proud to report that my python proficiency is back up (to a proficient level)
